# UnnamedWIP
A window, invisible to GoGuardian, with proxies, games, and more!

## How to use
Currently, you can't use it as it is in development, but when an early beta gets released (I will say here in the readme) here are the steps you can use:

## Bookmarklet
Go to unnamed.min.js (name subject to change) and copy the code. Bookmark any page (I use New Tab), right-click the bookmark, and click "edit". You can change the name to anything, but paste the code into the URL box. Now you can click the bookmarklet on any website to use it!

### The Problem with Bookmarklets
Many schools block bookmarklets. You can check if bookmarklets are blocked on your computer by going to chrome://policy and searching for "URLBlocklist." After clicking "Show More," look for "javascript://*". If it does show up, you cannot use bookmarklets.
Another way to do this is by using test.min.js as a bookmarklet, and then going to Google and clicking it. If nothing happens, bookmarklets are blocked.

## Alternatives
Because bookmarklets may be blocked, here are some alternatives.

### Opener
Download "openerbeta.html" and then open the file. If it works correctly, it should open the window and redirect to Google Classroom, not even showing up on your history. If not, make an issue!

### Extensions allowing JavaScript
My school allows the extension [Shortkeys](https://shortkeys.app), and one of the actions you can run on a keyboard shortcut is running JavaScript. You could paste the unnamed.js code into a box to be able to open it on a keyboard shortcut. I don't think most schools have this, though, so you could also try  using UBlock Origin to run it [like so.](https://github.com/3kh0/ext-remover?tab=readme-ov-file#ublock-run-run-code-on-pages) Check your extension allowlist, and if you find an extension that can run JavaScript, than this step could work for you!

### Website
I <b>*may*</b> add a website, which will work like the Opener, except without having to use any files. If I do this, it will be linked on the repo.

# That's all for now!
This repo is constantly recieving updates and changes. In its current form, the readme is the only file, but stay tuned, maybe watch the repository, and soon the beta will be released.
